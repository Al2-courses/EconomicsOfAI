**Course Overview**

This course explores the economic consequences of disruptive technologies, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI). We will focus on the technological (r)evolution that began in the 1960s and transformed the world into a networked economy in the following decades. This transformation has had significant economic implications, as disruptive technologies like the internet, social media, and AI have revolutionized market institutions, including firms, governments, and regulatory frameworks. Today, some scholars argue that AI-based technologies offer the potential to create a more efficient, free, and just society. Others, however, believe that AI companies should be regulated, as they may contribute to job loss, income inequality, and the undermining of democratic institutions.

**Research questions**

In what ways do peer-to-peer interactions on digital platforms contribute to economic value creation? How do these interactions affect market structures? What economic models underpin the provision of “free” services by social media companies, and how do these companies monetize user interactions and data to generate revenue? What are the legal and ethical considerations surrounding data ownership in the context of AI model training, and how do regulatory frameworks address the rights of data contributors versus AI companies? To what extent do digital markets adhere to the principles of the “invisible hand”? How is the automation of tasks through AI and robotics impacting job markets? What sectors or professions are most vulnerable to displacement or transformation in the coming decades?

And most importantly: **(Why) Should we (i.e., _netizens_) care?**

**Evaluation**

The course grade will consist of a 40% midterm exam and a 60% final exam. Attendance is not compulsory; however, students will be assigned to participate in online and offline activities during class hours. Participation in these activities will impact the final grade.
